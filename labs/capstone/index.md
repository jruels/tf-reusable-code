# Capstone lab

## Overview
This lab will combine all of the things learned throughout this class. You will not be given step-by-step instructions and will need to do some research on your own. 

Setup Terraform to use remote state. 

Create a module that:
  - Uses a data source to ensure the instances you create are from most recent Ubuntu 20.04 image
  - Create 3 instances
  - Creates an Elastic Load Balancer 
  - Creates a VPC 
  - Creates an S3 bucket

You should have a VPC, with a Load Balancer, and at least one EC2 instance running.

## Cleanup 
Destroy all resources
