## Lab Setup
In this lab, you will log into the AWS Console and start a CloudShell session. We will be using this for all future labs. 

### Log into the AWS Cloud Console
Log into the [AWS Console](https://d-916729713a.awsapps.com/start/) in a browser using the credentials from the spreadsheet.

Once you have logged in, select **AWS Account (1)** -> **Account (number)** -> **Management console**

On the top right side, select the **US West (N. California)** `us-west-1` region.

### Start the CloudShell 
After selecting the `us-west-1` region, use the search bar at the top of the page to search for `CloudShell`. 

## Cleanup
Remove any files from previous training sessions. 
```bash
rm -rf * && rm -rf .local
```

## Congratulations
You are now logged into the AWS CloudShell, and ready for future labs.
